The animation is made entirley from Vanilla JavaScript and utilizes the canvas element in HTML. I wrote a number of functions that loop through an array storing randomized data points. Each data point represents a location of one of the images being displayed on the canvas. A main function then runs continously using a timer, and changes the array data in an orderly fashion - which gives the illusion of movement. I also had some fun with the latest CSS trends while doing the rest of the styling. Feel free to take a look at the repository and take which ever code snipets you'd like!
